# Measuring the Benefit of Boyer-Moore's Algorithm
Boyer-Moore algorithms are significantly more efficient compared to naive exact matching; here, the improvement in workload of a Boyer-Moore algorithm was quantified by measuring the number of character comparisons performed and the number of alignments tested.

This exercise was part of Coursera's Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course as part of the Genomic Data Science specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins Unversity.
