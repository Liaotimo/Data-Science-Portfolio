# Data-Science-Portfolio
This portfolio includes some of my projects for self-learning and personal interests.

## Projects

- [Predicting Iris Species:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Gaspe%20Iris%20Classification%20Project/Iris%20Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)
In this project, the famous iris flower data set was used to train a model for prediction of iris species based on flower measurements. Ronald Fisher originally collected the majority of these samples in 1936 from the beautiful Gasp√© Peninsula in Quebec!

- [Mutation-Analysis-of-SARS-CoV-2-Sequences:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/SARS-COV-2%20RBD%20Mutation%20Analysis/SARS-CoV-2%20RBD%20Sequence%20Analysis.ipynb)
 In this project, mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequences were analyzed to determine the location of substitutions in a single-site mutagenesis library.
 
- [Grouping Universities by K Means Clustering:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Universities-Grouping-K-Means-Clustering-Project/blob/main/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb)
This project uses K Means Clustering to classify Universities into to two groups in comparison to Private vs Public.

- [Predicting Money Lending Outcome with Random Forests:]()

This project ueses a publicly available data set from [LendingClub.com](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) to predict individuals who have a high probability of returning money from a loan. This model would be used to connect money lenders with reliable borrowers.
