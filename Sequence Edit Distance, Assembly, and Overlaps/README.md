# Edit Distance, Assembly, and Overlaps

Dynamic Program can be used to find approximate occurences of a pattern sequence (p) in a reference text (t). Here, an algorithm was developed to calculate minimum edit distances between sample DNA sequences and a genome. In addition, methods were developed to efficiently find overlaps within a set of seuqencing reads.
