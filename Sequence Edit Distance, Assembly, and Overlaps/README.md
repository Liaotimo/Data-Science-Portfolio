# Edit Distance and Overlaps

Dynamic Program can be used to find approximate occurences of a pattern sequence (p) in a reference text (t). Here, an algorithm was developed to calculate minimum edit distances between sample DNA sequences and a genome. In addition, methods were developed to efficiently find overlaps within a set of sequencing reads.

This exercise was part of Coursera's Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course as part of the Genomic Data Science specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins Unversity.
