# Algorithms for Sequence Assembly

The shortest common superstring algorithm is developed and implemented for assembly of DNA sequences.

This exercise was part of Coursera's Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course as part of the Genomic Data Science specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins Unversity.
