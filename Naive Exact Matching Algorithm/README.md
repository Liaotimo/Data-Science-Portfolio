# Developing a Naive Matching Algorithm

Starting with a set of functions that implement a basic version of the naive exact matching, the goal here was to add in strand-awareness; the final algorithm is capable of searching for a pattern withing a reference genome text in both the forward and reverse complement orientation.

This exercise was part of Coursera's Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course as part of the Genomic Data Science specialization offered by the Johns Hopkins Unversity.
