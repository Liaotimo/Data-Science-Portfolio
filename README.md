## Projects

- [Predicting Iris Species by Measurements](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Gaspe%20Iris%20Classification%20Project)
In this project, the famous Iris flower data set was used to train a model for prediction of Iris species. This data set is composed of 150 samples containing measurements of three distinct Iris species. Ronald Fisher originally collected the majority of these samples in 1936 from the beautiful Gasp√© Peninsula in Quebec!
This exercise was part of Udemy's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp series provided by Pierian Data.
