## Projects

- [Predicting Iris Species](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Gaspe%20Iris%20Classification%20Project/Iris%20Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)
In this project, the famous Iris flower data set was used to train a model for prediction of Iris species based on flower measurements. Ronald Fisher originally collected the majority of these samples in 1936 from the beautiful Gasp√© Peninsula in Quebec!
