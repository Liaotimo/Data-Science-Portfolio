# Data-Science-Projects
This portfolio includes some of my projects for self-learning and personal interests.

## Genomics
- [Measuring the Benefit of Boyer-Moore's Algorithm for Sequence Alignment](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Boyer%20Moore%20Alignment/Boyer-Moore's%20Algorithm%20for%20Sequence%20Alignment.ipynb)
Boyer-Moore algorithms are significantly more efficient compared to naive exact matching; here, the improvement in workload of a Boyer-Moore algorithm was quantified by measuring the number of character comparisons performed and alignments tested.

- [Mutational Analysis of SARS CoV 2 Sequences:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/SARS-COV-2%20RBD%20Mutation%20Analysis/SARS-CoV-2%20RBD%20Sequence%20Analysis.ipynb)
Mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequences were analyzed to determine the location of substitutions in a single-site mutagenesis library.

- [Developing DNA Matching Algorithms:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/e858cdce74996cd68eb3269304c03da310521866/Naive%20Exact%20Matching%20Algorithm/Naive%20Exact%20Matching%20Algorithm.ipynb)
A naive matching algorithm was modified to be strand-aware. This algorithm was used to search and analyze a pattern sequences across a reference genome.

- [Developing an Algorithm for Sequence Assembly](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Sequence%20Assembly/Algorithms%20for%20Sequence%20Assembly.ipynb)
The shortest common superstring algorithm was developed and implemented for assembly of DNA sequences.

- [Sequence Edit Distance and Overlaps](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Sequence%20Edit%20Distance%2C%20Assembly%2C%20and%20Overlaps)
Dynamic Program can be used to find approximate occurences of a pattern sequence (p) in a reference text (t). Here, an algorithm was developed to calculate minimum edit distances between sample DNA sequences and a genome. In addition, methods were developed to efficiently find overlaps within a set of seuqencing reads.

## Machine Learning

- [Predicting Iris Species:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Gaspe%20Iris%20Classification%20Project/Iris%20Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)
The famous iris flower data set was used to train a model for prediction of iris species based on flower measurements. Ronald Fisher originally collected the majority of these samples in 1936 from the beautiful Gasp√© Peninsula in Quebec!
 
- [Grouping Universities by K Means Clustering:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Universities-Grouping-K-Means-Clustering-Project/blob/main/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb)
K Means Clustering was used to classify Universities into to two groups in comparison to Private vs Public.

- [Predicting Money Lending Outcome with Random Forests:](https://github.com/Liaotimo/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Lending%20Club%20Money%20Loan%20Prediction/Lending%20Club%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project.ipynb)
[LendingClub.com](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) data was used to predict individuals who have a high probability of returning money from a loan. This model would be used to connect money lenders with reliable borrowers.
